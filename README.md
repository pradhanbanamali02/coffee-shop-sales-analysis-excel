# ‚òï Coffee Shop Sales Analysis ‚Äî Excel Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This is my **first data analytics project**, where I explored and analyzed real-world business data using **Microsoft Excel**.  
After working for about 2 years in the **pharmaceutical industry**, I realized I wanted more challenges and learning opportunities ‚Äî so I decided to transition into **data analytics**.  

For this project, I used the **Coffee Shop Sales dataset** provided by **[Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground)**.  
The dataset contains **149,117 transactions** from **January to June 2023** across **3 store locations**.  

The main goal was to analyze sales performance, customer buying patterns, and store revenue, and to design an interactive Excel dashboard that presents clear business insights.

## Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading
- Imported the raw dataset (`Coffee Shop Sales.csv`) into Excel.  
- Checked and corrected data types (dates, times, numeric values).  
- Verified for missing or duplicate records.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning (Power Query)
- Removed duplicate and blank rows.  
- Corrected inconsistent product and store names.  
- Filtered out unnecessary columns.  
- Ensured each column had the correct data type.  
- Loaded the cleaned data into the Excel Data Model.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Transformation
Created new calculated columns in Power Query:
- **Total Bill** = `Unit Price √ó Transaction Quantity`
- **Month Name**
- **Day Name**
- **Hour**
- **Day of Week**
- **Month Number**

Reorganized the dataset to make it easier to analyze.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Modeling (Power Pivot)
Built measures and KPIs in Power Pivot:
- `Total Sales = SUM(Total Bill)`  
- `Total Footfall = COUNT(Transaction_ID)`  
- `Average Order Value = Total Sales / Total Footfall`  
- `Avg Items per Transaction = Total Items Sold / Total Transactions`

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Development
Used **Pivot Tables** and **Pivot Charts** to visualize:
- Monthly Sales Trends  
- Category-wise Sales  
- Product Size Performance  
- Top 5 Best-Selling Products  
- Store-wise Revenue & Footfall  
- Hourly Quantity Ordered  
- Daily Transaction Count  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Design & Formatting
- Added **Slicers** for Month and Day filters.  
- Used consistent color schemes and clear labels.  
- Applied **conditional formatting** to highlight key data points.  
- Arranged visuals neatly to tell a smooth story.

## üìä Key Metrics
| KPI | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Total Sales** | Total revenue generated |
| **Total Footfall** | Total number of transactions |
| **Average Order Value (AOV)** | Total Sales √∑ Total Footfall |
| **Avg Items per Transaction** | Total Items Sold √∑ Total Transactions |

## Key Insights
1. **Coffee (Small size)** is the most sold product, followed by Tea.  
2. Sales are highest during **morning hours (7 AM ‚Äì 11 AM)**, then remain steady throughout the day.  
3. Overall **sales and footfall increased month by month** from January to June 2023.  
4. Among all 3 stores, one location consistently performs best in both sales and footfall.  
5. Customers prefer smaller-sized beverages, but larger sizes generate more revenue per order.  
6. The **Average Order Value** stayed consistent, showing stable customer spending patterns.
